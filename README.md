# Harmonic-Emission-Estimation-Tool-for-EV-chargers
Fast charging stations (FCSs) are crucial for the rollout of Electric Vehicles (EVs). However, the power quality impact of them is still unknown. To maintain the compatibility of the power grid with massive introduction of FCSs, we need to investigate the potential power quality problems induced by the DC fast chargers. The non-fundamental emission (harmonics, interharmonics, and supraharmonics) noncompliance is one of the most possible problems. 

To estimate the harmonic emission of DC fast chargers (DCFCs), impedance based approach is commonly used. It is a small signal model that can be used to analyze the harmonic emission of the DCFC in certain steady state. The harmonic emission of the DCFC in certain transient is not of interest because of their short duration and thereby non-prominant heat generation and energy loss. The impedance model of the charger-grid system is shown below. As seen, the charger is simplified with Norton equivalent circuit, whereas the grid system is simplified with Thevenin equivalent circuit. To estimate the harmonic emission of the charger with certain grid impedance $Z_g$ and background harmonics $V_g$, we need to know the harmonic source $I_c$ and input impedance $Z_c$ of the charger.\
